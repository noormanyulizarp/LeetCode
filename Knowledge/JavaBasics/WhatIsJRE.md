# What is JRE?

The **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** is a software layer that provides the necessary environment to run Java applications. It is a part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and includes the following components:

## Key Components of JRE
1. **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: Executes Java bytecode and provides platform independence.
2. **Class Libraries**: Predefined libraries that provide essential functionality for Java programs.
3. **Class Loader**: Loads Java classes into memory when required.
4. **Runtime Tools**: Tools like `java` (to run applications) and `javaw` (to run GUI-based applications without a console).

## Purpose of JRE
- It allows users to run Java applications without needing the full JDK.
- It provides the runtime environment required for Java programs to execute.

## How JRE Differs from JDK
- **JRE**: Only for running Java applications.
- **JDK**: Includes JRE along with development tools like `javac` (compiler) and debugging utilities.

## Installation
JRE can be downloaded and installed separately from the official [Oracle Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) page or other trusted sources.
