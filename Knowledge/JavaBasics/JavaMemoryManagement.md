### Stack Memory
Stack memory is used for static memory allocation. It stores method calls, local variables, and references to objects in the heap. Each time a method is called, a new block is created on the top of the stack, and when the method execution is completed, the block is removed. This memory is automatically managed and has a Last In First Out (LIFO) structure.

### Heap Memory
Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation. It is where Java objects are stored. Unlike stack memory, heap memory is not automatically managed; it requires garbage collection to free up memory that is no longer in use. Objects in the heap can be accessed from anywhere in the application, making it suitable for storing data that needs to persist beyond the scope of a single method.

### Memory Allocation
When an object is created using the `new` keyword, memory is allocated in the heap. The reference to this object is stored in the stack. For example:

```java
MyClass obj = new MyClass();
```

In this case, `obj` is a reference stored in the stack, while the actual `MyClass` object is stored in the heap.

### Garbage Collection
Java has an automatic garbage collection mechanism that helps manage memory by identifying and disposing of objects that are no longer reachable from the application. This process helps prevent memory leaks and optimizes memory usage. The garbage collector runs in the background and can be triggered manually using `System.gc()`, although this is not guaranteed to run immediately.

### Conclusion
Understanding memory management in Java is essential for writing efficient applications. By leveraging stack and heap memory appropriately and relying on garbage collection, developers can ensure that their applications run smoothly and efficiently.
