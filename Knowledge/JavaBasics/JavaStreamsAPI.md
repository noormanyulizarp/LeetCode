# Java Streams API

The Java Streams API, introduced in Java 8, is a powerful feature that allows developers to process sequences of elements (such as collections) in a functional style. It provides a high-level abstraction for performing operations on data, enabling more concise and readable code.

## Key Features of Java Streams API

1. **Functional Programming**: The Streams API supports functional programming concepts, allowing developers to write code that is more declarative and expressive.

2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Streams are evaluated lazily, meaning that computations are not performed until the result is actually needed. This can lead to performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets.

3. **Pipelining**: Operations on streams can be chained together to form a pipeline. This allows for a sequence of transformations and computations to be applied in a single pass.

4. **Parallel Processing**: The Streams API makes it easy to process data in parallel, leveraging multi-core architectures to improve performance.

## Basic Operations

The Streams API provides several operations that can be performed on streams, including:

- **Intermediate Operations**: These operations return a new stream and are lazy. Examples include `filter()`, `map()`, and `sorted()`.
  
- **Terminal Operations**: These operations produce a result or a side-effect and close the stream. Examples include `collect()`, `forEach()`, and `reduce()`.

## Example Usage

Here is a simple example demonstrating the use of the Streams API to filter and collect elements from a list:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve");

        // Using Streams to filter names that start with 'A' and collect them into a new list
        List<String> filteredNames = names.stream()
                                           .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
                                           .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println(filteredNames); // Output: [Alice]
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a list of names and use the Streams API to filter out names that start with the letter 'A'. The result is collected into a new list and printed to the console.

## Conclusion

The Java Streams API is a powerful tool for processing collections of data in a functional style. By leveraging its features, developers can write more concise, readable, and efficient code. Whether you're filtering, mapping, or reducing data, the Streams API provides a flexible and expressive way to handle data processing in Java.
